These are various things I decided to code because I got a new laptop and wanted to try some stuff.

CircularLinkedList.java:
  I didn't know what else to call this, but it is named sort of appropriately.  Basically a doubly linked list with no true head or tail.  Although, it does still keep track of the head and tail, but mostly just to avoid weird infinite loop issues.
  You can move forwards and backwards through it, or since it is circular clockwise and counter-clockwise.
